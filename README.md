# Hi there! 👋 I'm Bilal Ahlam

I’m a BSc Computer Science student and software developer who loves **building games, web apps, and interactive software**. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving problems, and turning ideas into working projects.

**Languages & Tools:** Java, C++, C#, TypeScript, Node.js, SQL

When I’m not coding, I enjoy **gaming, swimming**, and finding creative ways to apply tech to real-world challenges. Feel free to explore my repos and projects — I’d love to hear your feedback or collaborate!
